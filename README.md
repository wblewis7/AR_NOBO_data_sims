# AR_NOBO_data.gzip
Empirical data comes for the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) project are stored in the "AR_NOBO_data" gzip file. Calling bobwhite groups (coveys) were surveyed via point counts and autonomous recording units (ARUs) in the fall of 2022 at eight study sites across
Arkansas, USA. Trained observers performed 600-m radius point counts at 3 - 6 survey locations at each study study (29 total locations), recording the number of calling coveys and the distance to the observer. Distances were grouped into 6 100-m bins for analysis. Surveys were performed from 45 minutes before to 15 minutes after sunrise and were repeated an average of 3 times (range 1 - 5). SM mini Wildlife Acoustic ARUs were deployed at 2 - 5 locations surveyed by point counts in each study site (26 total locations), set to record each day during the same time period as point counts. ARU recordings from days with inclement weather (measured precipitation > 0 or wind speeds > 16 kmph) were removed. Deployment dates for ARUs ranged from October 1 - Novemeber 10. Bobwhite calls were detected in ARU recordings using a previously developed convolutional neural network and a score threshold of 0.95. In a preliminary analysis, the detection radius for ARUs was determined to be smaller than for point counts. Point counts were performed at the same locations as ARUs, so point counts surveyed the entire area surveyed by ARUs plus an additional area.
## y.PC
Formatted point count survey data giving the total number of bobwhite covey detections per survey. Rows represent unique survey locations while columns represent repeat surveys at the same location. NA values represent no survey for that number of visits at a location.
## ydb.PC
Formatted point count survey data giving the number of bobwhite covey detections in each detection bin per survey. The first dimension of the array corresponds to unique survey locations, the second dimension represents the 6 distance bins (0-100m, 100-200m, 200-300m,
300-400m, 400-500m, 500-600m), and the third dimension represents repeat surveys at the same location.

Vector giving the point location at which each ARU was deployed.
## ARU.noise
Matrix giving standardized values of background noise on ARU recordings. Rows represent ARUs and columns represent days of recordings during the deployment period. Background noise was used to assess variation in the calling/detection parameter (delta)

# Analyzing_AR_NOBO_data.R
Sample code for jointly estimating abundance of bobwhite coveys from fall distance-sampling point count and ARU data is provided in Analyzing_AR_NOBO_data.R. Point count and ARU data are integrated in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Both datasets jointly estimate the state (abundance) process but have seperate observation processes. We use a modified version of the statistical model of Doser et al. 2021 (Integrating automated acoustic vocalization data and point count surveys for estimation of bird abundance), with modifications by Nolan et al. 2024 (Effects of management practices on Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus density in privately owned working forests across the Southeastern United States). Point counts are incorporated via a hierarchical distance-sampling model (Royle et al. 2004 Modeling abundance effects in distance sampling) with a Half-Normal detection function (Addressing temporal variability in bird calling with design and estimation: A Northern Bobwhite example), modified to account for repeat surveys. ARU data are incorporated via a zero-truncated hurdle model and account for false positives and negatives. We model abundance as varying by study site, while the ARU detection process varies by site and background noise of recordings. A subset of detections are manually validated and incorporated with a Hypergeometric formulation to correct for false positives.

# Generating_analyzing_NOBO_simulation_data.R
Sample code for generating and analyzing simulated datasets to assess the efficacy of Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate abundance of bobwhite coveys from point counts and ARUs. Code is provided to simulate point count, ARU, and manually-validated false positive data and then to use models similar to in Analyzing_AR_NOBO_data.R for estimating abundance. Data were simulated for a hypothetical 2016 ha study area with average bird density of 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.3, 1.7, 2.1, and 2.5 birds/ha (and assuming 12 birds per covey). Simulated data was generated with surveying either 22, 34, 45, or 56% of the study area (4, 6, 8, or 10 survey locations) with either point counts (model C), ARUs with manual validation of a subset of detections (model AV), or both (AVC). Point counts were repeated 2 - 4 times, while ARUs were deployed for either 14 or 28 days. 100 datasets were simulated for each of the 308 scenarios.
Simulation parameters were based on analysis of point count and ARU data on bobwhite abundance from Arkansas, USA, 2022. Analysis of the Arkansas data suggested that the number of detections across recordings on the same ARU was highly variable, and this varition was poorly explained by estimates of the parameter (delta), which governs the calling rate and detection probability of bobwhite calls on ARUS. We therefore used a slightly different procedure between the data generation process and the statistical model for calculating delta. We believe that this method of data generation creates more biologically realistic data, thus better assessing the performance of the statistical model on ecological datasets; however, we acknowledge that the simulations are unlikely to be able to recover parameters associated with the ARU detection process. We therefore only assessed model performance of density estimates and the associated parameter Î²_0.
Data are analyzed via Bayesian hierarchical models based on the models of Doser et al, 2021 (Integrating automated acoustic vocalization data and point count surveys for estimation of bird abundance), with modifications by Nolan et al. 2024 (Effects of management practices on Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus density in privately owned working forests across the Southeastern United States). Point count data are incorporated via distance-sampling models modified for repeat surveys, while ARU data are incorporated via a zero-truncated hurdle model to account for false positives and false negatives.
