Empirical data comes for the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) project are stored in the "AR_NOBO_data" gzip file. Calling bobwhite groups (coveys) were surveyed via point counts and autonomous recording units (ARUs) in the fall of 2017 at eight study areas across
Arkansas, USA. Trained observers performed 600-m radius point counts at 3 - 6 survey locations at each study area, recording the number of calling coveys and the distance to the observer. Distances were grouped into 6 100-m bins for analysis. Surveys were performed from
45 minutes before to 15 minutes after sunrise and were repeated an average of 3 times (range 1 - 5). SM mini Wildlife Acoustic ARUs were deployed at 2 - 5 count locations in each study area, set to record each day during the same time period as point counts. Bobwhite calls 
were detected in ARU recordings using a previously developed convolutional neural network and a score threshold of 0.95.
